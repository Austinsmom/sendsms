 what is this?
 Little program for sending sms from command line trough sms-tools server implementation
 program can be compiled for unix and windows operating systems

Why:
 Needed to send sms from different system in local network without need for
 multiple gsm modems per machine :)
  

usage:
 sendsms -s <SERVER IP ADDRESS> -p <PORT NUMBER> -b <GSM NUMBER TO> -t "<TEXT TO BE SENT>" -c [sending check]


Example:
 sendsms -s 10.11.10.20 -p 80 -b 11111222333 -t "orao pao" -c       // this way if you need confirmation from modem (not network!!!)
 sendsms -s 10.11.10.20 -p 80 -b 11111222333 -t "orao pao"          // no confirmation

Program output:
SMSSTATUS: FAILED                    // if somehting is wrong it will be printed on stdout
SMSSTATUS: SENT                      // message is sent (from gsm modem perspective)
SMSSTATUS: SENT (NO CHECK)!          // no checks on sending performed ( param -c is not used)
SMSSTATUS: POSSIBLE FAIL (TIMEOUT)   // Loop (sleep(5) x 10 ) didn't had any good response it could be ok but who knows...


Security:

 basic idea is that smstools has /etc/smsd.white whitelisting support
 meaning only authorized users would be able to receive messages
 System logs from which IP address message was sent.

Web Server:

 Put sendsms.php into server root so it can be reached from sendsms binary with /sendsms.php url
